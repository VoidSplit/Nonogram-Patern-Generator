## Generate your own Nonogram Patterns!
This generator is linked with a <a href="https://lddd.dev/ext_lddd/pages/game_nonogramme/">friend project</a>, a nonogram game.
We can use your patterns generated by this generator using a JSON code.

## How to share your patterns?

First, create your pattern using the generator, then click on the button "export" a JSON code appeared on the output box. 
Copy this code and create an issue on this repository, we will check and validate your patterns to use them.

## Reglementation

The patterns must respect certain rules, first the size must be 5 pixels minimum and 12 maximum, any invalid size will not be validated.
second, they must not contain any shocking, defamatory or hateful message.

Please make patterns representing something, not random patterns! :)
